# Joy Division _Unknown Pleasures_ Plot

Recreating Joy Division's [iconic album artwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures) in Python, using Matplotlib, Pandas, and the [pulsar.csv](https://gist.github.com/borgar/31c1e476b8e92a11d7e9) dataset.

The original artwork was created using electromagnetic radio waves from pulsar PSR B1919+21, discovered by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967.

Here's my rendering:
